# HelloRaspberryPiAsInputHub
What if you want to remap you Xbox controller on a Xbox game on your PC ?  That the kind of stuff we can do with a Android or Raspberry Hub.


With my projects OMI, I try to create tool to remap and inject key in aim to better play at game.  

I am often stuck on the fact that I want to read Xbox or controller but the game is using it too.   
So it would fit to have a raspberry PI Hub that read input then inject some or share on a network to be used the info of what input are on.  


_I bought a Raspberry Pi 4B to do that and will probably buy a Raspberry Pi 5 later next year._
